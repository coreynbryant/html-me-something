                    <h1>PAC-MAN &trade;</h1>
                    <p>In 1982, Atari Inc. released their version of Namco's hit arcade game Pac-Man for its Atari 2600 video game console. Like the original arcade version, the player controls the title character with a joystick. The object is to traverse a maze, consuming all the wafers within while avoiding four ghosts.</p>

                    <p>The game was programmed by Tod Frye, who was given a very limited time frame by Atari to complete the project. The technical differences between the Atari 2600 console and the original's arcade hardware—particularly the amount of available memory—presented several challenges to Frye. Given the popularity of the property, Atari produced approximately 12 million units (which was more than the estimated number of Atari 2600 consoles sold at the time), anticipating a high number of sales.</p>

                    <p>It is the best selling Atari 2600 game of all time; it sold an estimated 7 million copies, and was the best-selling home video game of all time when it was released.[4] However, critics have considered it among the worst video games of all-time, criticizing its controls and visuals. Initially, the port boosted the video game industry's presence in retail. It was followed by Atari 2600 ports of Pac-Man's arcade sequels.</p>

                    <h1>MS. PAC-MAN &trade;</h1>
                    <p>Ms. Pac-Man is an arcade video game from the Golden Age. It was produced by Illinois-based Midway Manufacturing corporation, the North American publisher of Pac-Man. Ms. Pac-Man was released in North America in January 1982, and is one of the most popular arcade video games of all time. This popularity led to its adoption as an official title by Namco, the creator of Pac-Man, which was released in the United States in late 1980. Ms. Pac-Man introduced a female protagonist, new maze designs, and several other improved gameplay changes over the original Pac-Man. Ms. Pac-Man became the most successful American-produced arcade game of 1981, selling 115,000 arcade cabinets.</p>

                    <p>Jr. Pac-Man is an arcade game, released by Bally Midway on January 1, 1983. It is based on Pac-Man and its derivatives but, like Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, and Pac-Man Plus, was created without the authorization of Namco. This was one of several games that would eventually lead to the termination of the licensing agreement between Namco and Bally Midway in 1984.</p>
